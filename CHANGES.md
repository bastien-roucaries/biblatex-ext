# Version <version> (<date>)
- Fixed inner cite delims for authoryear/authortitle and their ibid versions.
- Fixed delimiters for `\smartcite`.
  `\smartcite` really behaves like `\parencite` and `\footcite` now.
  This needed some trickery to get the delimiter context right.

# Version 0.1 (2018-03-18)
- First public release.
