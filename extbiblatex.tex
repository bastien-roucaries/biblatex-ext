\section{Introduction}\label{sec:int}
The \sty{extbiblatex} package provides an extended version of the standard
styles that come with \sty{biblatex}.
For each standard style this package provides a style with the same name
prefixed with \texttt{ext-} which can be used as a drop-in replacement for the
standard style -- for example, the replacement for \texttt{authoryear-icomp}
is called \texttt{ext-authoryear-icomp}.

The aim of this package is to offer a simple interface to change some of the
stylistic decisions made for the standard styles.
Additionally, some customisation features that were not deemed appropriate
for inclusion in the \sty{biblatex} kernel are provided.

\subsection{Requirements}
The use of the styles requires a current version of the \sty{biblatex} package.
At the time of writing the latest version of \sty{biblatex} is \biblatexversion,
that version is required for the styles to work properly.
A warning will be issued if you use an older version; you may choose to ignore
that warning, but the style can not be guaranteed to work properly in that case:
you might get other warnings, errors, or the style might fail silently.

Use of the \biber{} backend is strongly encouraged.
No features of this package require \biber{} explicitly in their implementation,
but many \sty{biblatex} standard features require \biber{} to function properly.

\subsection{License}
Permission is granted to copy, distribute and\slash or modify this software
under the terms of the \lppl, version 1.3c.%

The current maintainer of this work is Moritz Wemheuer (\textcopyright 2017--2018).


\subsection{Feedback}\label{subsec:int:feb}

Please use the \sty{extbiblatex} project page on GitHub to report bugs and
submit feature requests.\footnote{\url{\gitbaseurl}}

If you do not want to report a bug or request a feature, but are simply in need
of assistance, you might want to consider posting your question on the
\texttt{comp.text.tex} newsgroup or \tex{} -- \latex Stack Exchange.%
\fnurl{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/biblatex}

\section{Usage}

\sty{extbiblatex} is not a standalone package, instead it is a collection of
\sty{biblatex} style files.

You can load the styles exactly as you would load the standard styles:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=latex,escapeinside={(*@}{@*)}]{}
\usepackage[style=(*@$\langle$\normalfont\emph{style}$\rangle$@*)]{biblatex}
\end{lstlisting}

The naming of the styles follows the scheme
\mbox{\texttt{ext-}$\langle$\emph{standard style}$\rangle$}, e.g.,
the style corresponding to \texttt{authoryear-icomp} is called
\texttt{ext-authoryear-icomp}.

\subsection{Styles}
Please refer to the \sty{biblatex} documentation%
\fnurl{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/biblatex/doc/biblatex.pdf}
and the style examples%
\fnurl{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/biblatex/doc/examples/}
for a more detailed description of each standard style.
The relations between the styles are exactly as in their standard counterparts.
The \texttt{ext-} styles only build on top of the standard files.
\begin{marglist}
\item[ext-numeric]
An extended version of the standard \texttt{numeric} style for citations with
numeric labels: \enquote{[1, 2, 3, 5, 7]}.

\item[ext-numeric-comp]
An extended version of the standard \texttt{numeric-comp} style.
The style is similar to \texttt{ext-numeric}, but citation labels are
compressed to give \enquote{[1--3, 5--7]} instead of
\enquote{[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]}.

\item[ext-numeric-verb]
An extended version of the standard \texttt{numeric-verb} style.
This style is similar to the \texttt{numeric} style, but each citation label
is in its own set of brackets: \enquote{[1], [2], [3]}.

\item[ext-alphabetic]
An extended version of the standard \texttt{alphabetic} style for citations with
alphabetic labels derived from author name and year: \enquote{[SR98, Knu84c]}.

\item[ext-alphabetic-verb]
An extended version of the standard \texttt{alphabetic-verb} style.
This style is based on \texttt{ext-alphabetic}, but like
\texttt{ext-numeric-verb} places each citation label in its own pair of
brackets: \enquote{[SR98], [Knu84c]}.

\item[ext-authoryear]
An extended version of the standard \texttt{authoryear} style for citations
using author name and year: \enquote{Sigfridsson and Ryde 1998}.

\item[ext-authoryear-comp]
An extended version of the standard \texttt{authoryear-comp} style.
The style is based on the author-year citations of \texttt{ext-authoryear},
but several works by the same author are compressed by not displaying the
author multiple times: \enquote{Knuth 1984, 1986} instead of
\enquote{Knuth 1984; Knuth 1986}.

\item[ext-authoryear-ibid]
An extended version of the standard \texttt{authoryear-ibid} style.
This style is similar to \texttt{ext-authoryear}, but repeated citations are
replaced with \enquote{ibidem}.

\item[ext-authoryear-icomp]
An extended version of the standard \texttt{authoryear-icomp} style.
This style combines the two styles \texttt{ext-authoryear-comp} and
\texttt{ext-authoryear-ibid}.

\item[ext-authortitle]
An extended version of the standard \texttt{authortitle} style for citations
by author and title: \enquote{Maron, Animal Triste}.

\item[ext-authortitle-comp]
An extended version of the standard \texttt{authortitle-comp} style.
Based on \texttt{ext-authortitle} this style compresses several citations
by the same author just like \texttt{ext-authoryear-comp}:
\enquote{Aristotle, \emph{Physics}, \emph{Poetics}} instead of
\enquote{Aristotle, \emph{Physics}; Aristotle, \emph{Poetics}}.

\item[ext-authortitle-ibid]
An extended version of the standard \texttt{authortitle-ibid} style.
This style is similar to \texttt{ext-authortitle}, but replaces repeated
citations of the same work with \enquote{ibidem}.

\item[ext-authortitle-icomp]
An extended version of the standard \texttt{authortitle-icomp} style.
This style combines \texttt{ext-authortitle-comp} and
\texttt{ext-authortitle-ibid}.

\item[ext-authortitle-terse]
An extended version of the standard \texttt{authortitle-terse} style.
This style is similar to \texttt{ext-authortitle}, but the title is omitted in
citations if there is only one work by the relevant author.

\item[ext-authortitle-tcomp]
An extended version of the standard \texttt{authortitle-tcomp} style.
This style combines \texttt{ext-authortitle-terse} and
\texttt{ext-authortitle-comp}.

\item[ext-authortitle-ticomp]
An extended version of the standard \texttt{authortitle-ticomp} style.
This style combines \texttt{ext-authortitle-terse},
\texttt{ext-authortitle-comp} and \texttt{ext-authortitle-ibid}.


\item[ext-verbose]
An extended version of the standard \texttt{verbose} style.
This style shows the full bibliographic reference the first time a work is
cited.

\item[ext-verbose-ibid]
An extended version of the standard \texttt{verbose-ibid} style.
Based on \texttt{ext-verbose}, repeated citations to the same work are replaced
with \enquote{ibidem}.

\item[ext-verbose-note]
An extended version of the standard \texttt{verbose-note} style.
Based on \texttt{ext-verbose} and intended for use in footnotes, subsequent
citations link back to the footnote the entry was cited at first and in full.

\item[ext-verbose-inote]
An extended version of the standard \texttt{verbose-inote} style.
Similar to \texttt{verbose-note}, but repeated citations to the same work are
replaced with \enquote{ibidem}.

\item[ext-verbose-trad1]
An extended version of the standard \texttt{verbose-trad1} style.
This style makes extensive use of scholarly abbreviations and is otherwise
similar to \texttt{ext-verbose}.

\item[ext-verbose-trad2]
An extended version of the standard \texttt{verbose-trad2} style.
The style is similar to \texttt{ext-\hspace{0pt}verbose-\hspace{0pt}inote} and
uses scholarly abbreviations to shorten citations.

\item[ext-verbose-trad3]
An extended version of the standard \texttt{verbose-trad3} style.
This style is similar to \texttt{ext-\hspace{0pt}verbose-\hspace{0pt}trad2}.
\end{marglist}


\subsection{Options}
All options of the \sty{biblatex} package are supported and each style supports
the options of its standard counterpart.

Additionally all style support the following options in global, per-type and
per-entry scope.

\begin{optionlist}
\boolitem[true]{articlein}
Whether or not to display \enquote{in:} before the journal information in
\bibtype{article} entries.

\boolitem[false]{innamebeforetitle}
Whether or not the \bibfield{editor} should be moved before the
\bibfield{booktitle} field for \bibtype{inbook}, \bibtype{incollection} and
\bibtype{inproceedings} entries.

\boolitem[false]{innameidem}
Whether or not the \bibfield{editor} of the \bibfield{booktitle}
for the entry types \bibtype{inbook}, \bibtype{incollection} and
\bibtype{inproceedings} is replaced by \enquote{idem} in case the
\bibfield{editor} and \bibfield{author} name lists coincide.

\boolitem[false]{inxref}
This option controls if \bibtype{inbook}, \bibtype{incollection} and
\bibtype{inproceedings} entries that are tied to a parent entry with
\bibfield{xref} or \bibfield{crossref} should cite their parent in the
bibliography if the parent is listed in the bibliography as an entry.
With the default setting \kvopt{inxref}{false} the parent is not cited, the
information is shown as in the standard styles. If the option is set to 
\texttt{true} the block following the \enquote{in:} is replaced by a citation
to the parent entry.
\end{optionlist}

\subsection{Field Formats}
